Fixes #

<!--
Are you targeting the right branch?

- net6.0
  - This PR should be part of a .NET 6 service release.
- main (start here if you don't know what to use)
  - This PR should wait until .NET 7 is released.
- net7.0
  - This PR is very specific to .NET 7 SDK updates and wouldn't compile if they were to target main.
